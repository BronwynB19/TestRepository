# Test Repository File

"""
I figured out how to add files
    Just make a new file and save it in the repository directory
"""

"""
Now I gotta learn about 
    Commit
        Updates local repository
    Push
        Updates remote repository(GitHub) (i think u only do this when it's 100% ready to go in)
        Changes on remote pository are not there until you push
    Pull
        Updates your local branch with changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
    Fetch
        Fetches changes from the remote repository but doesn't automatically merge them into your current branch
    Remove
    Branch commands
        git branch: shows branches and current branch
        git branch -c new_branch_name: creates a new branch with new_branch_name
        git checkout branch_name: sets current working branch to branch_name

"""

"""
When you move branches without committing(on desktop), changes get stashed and need to be restored and committed
git add (file_name or .)
git commit (write a comment, save, and close that window) 
"""

How to branch a branch?
My git status doesnt give me "up to date" like the video, says my branch is ahead by 3 commits?
Having a tricky time getting git commit to work, but i can do it fine in desktop?
What are pull requests on web?
Video didn't show how to join branches. How do that?
    Is this merging? I'd assume yes.
Having a tricky time understanding commands in desktop vs terminal
    git add > git commit = commit on desktop
    git push origin HEAD = push origin/main on desktop
Does Merge get rid of the branch?
"""

"""
So before this, it seemed like my branches were still separate, but contained the same data when i clicked "fetch origin/main" on desktop
